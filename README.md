# Malware-Detection-using-Deep-Learning

## Installations:
CUDA - 9.0
CuDNN - 7.0.5
Python - 3.5+
Anaconda - 3

## Python Libraries :
	-Tensorflow .
	-Windows version x86 exe(local).
	-Pillow.
	-Numpy.

## Steps:
  - If you don't have benign files, use the benignGenerator.py to crawl your local machines and collect .exe files, which you can use as nenign files in your dataset.
  - Update the paths in ias.py file according to the location of the files. Use absolute paths.
	- Make sure the folders in path2 and path3 (destination of the output images 256x256 and 32x32 respectively) are created beforehand.
	- Run the ias_full.py file.
  - Update the paths in cnn1.py and build_image_data.py files according to the location of the files. Use absolute paths.
	- Run build_image_data.py. Make sure that label.txt is in the same folder as build_image_data as well as the folders(named after the 
		classes in label.txt) are in the same folder.
	- Run the build_image_data.py file. After running the file you should see "train-00000-of-00002.tfrecord" and 
		"train-00000-of-00002.tfrecord" files created.
	- Run cnn1.py. This will take a long time to run.
	- Update the paths in cnn1.py and build_image_data.py files according to the location of the files. Use absolute paths.
	- Run build_image_data.py. Make sure that label.txt is in the same folder as build_image_data as well as the folders(named after the 
		classes in label.txt) are in the same folder.
	- Run the build_image_data.py file. After running the file you should see "train-00000-of-00002.tfrecord" and 
		"train-00000-of-00002.tfrecord" files created.
	- Run cnn1.py. This will take a long time to run.
